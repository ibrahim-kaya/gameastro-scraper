# gameastro-scraper [node.js]
GameAstro Scraper is a simple web scraper that scrapes the game stores which offers free games, for game names and their store links.

It's purpose is to get web page content as JSON to extract game names and links to the store.

I'm extracting game data and links, in my GameHut Laravel project with PHP and adding them to the database and showing them in my website https://gameastro.net
